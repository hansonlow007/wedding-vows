                        <h2>Jeremiah's Vow</h2>
                        <p>My dear Hanson,</p>
                        <p>Today has finally arrived, and I can openly and officially call you "husband" in front of everyone! For the past 15 years, I've been calling you that in private, and now being able to say it so openly still fills me with immense excitement and emotion.</p>
                        <p>I thank the Lord for His grace and faithfulness, allowing us to meet, know, and love each other, from companionship to commitment. Thank you for unconditionally loving me, being patient with me, supporting me, and trusting me, even during the darkest and most challenging moments of my life. It is precisely because of your love—that love which mirrors God's enduring patience—that constantly inspires and encourages me, giving me the motivation to become a better person and teaching me how to truly love—whether it's loving God, loving those around me, or loving myself.</p>
                        <p>In the past, I prayed to God for revelation, wanting to know if you were the one He had prepared for me. It wasn't until God used someone's testimony to show me—when someone can love all of you unconditionally, both your strengths and weaknesses, that person is the right one. And in that moment, I suddenly realized that person had always been you. At the same time, I remembered a prayer I offered to God in my youth—a desire to meet someone who would truly love me. Looking back now, I realize that you were God's answer to that prayer.</p>
                        <p>Today, in the presence of God and our loved ones, I make this eternal covenant with you, built upon the unshakable foundation of Jesus Christ.</p>
                        <p>Whether the days ahead bring mountaintops or valleys, I promise to love you, respect you, accompany you, listen to you, support you, and carefully protect you with Christ's love for the rest of my life. From this day forward, I promise to dedicate my life to fulfilling yours, building our home together hand in hand. I promise to hold your hand and create more beautiful memories together until the last moment of our lives. At the same time, I promise to let Christ be the Lord of our love and marriage, taking each step toward the future, fulfilling God's shared dreams and mission in our lives, and together witnessing Christ's never-ending love.</p>
                        <p>I pray that God will protect our marriage, that our love will withstand all trials, that all storms will only bring us closer, and that we will remain steadfast and unshaken in Christ's love.</p>
                        <p>My husband, I love you, from the past, through the present, and into the future, until the day we return to our heavenly home!</p>

                        <h2>Jeremiah的誓言</h2>
                        <p>我親愛的 Hanson，</p>
                        <p>今天終於來臨，我可以在眾人面前大大方方、正式地叫你一聲「老公」！這15年來，我早已在私下這樣稱呼你，而如今能如此光明正大地說出口，仍讓我無比激動與感動。</p>
                        <p>感謝主的恩典與信實，讓我們能夠相遇、相識、相愛，從相處走到相守。謝謝你一直以來無條件地愛我、包容我、支持我、信任我，即便在我生命中幾次最黑暗與低潮的時刻，你依然不離不棄。也正是因為你的愛——那份如同上帝恒久忍耐的愛——時時激勵並鼓舞著我，讓我更有動力成為更好的自己，也讓我不斷學習如何真正去愛——無論是愛上帝、愛身邊的人，還是愛我自己。</p>
                        <p>過去，我曾向上帝祈求啟示，想知道你是否就是祂為我預備的那一位。直到上帝透過某人的見證讓我明白——當一個人能夠無條件地愛你的全部，無論是優點還是缺點，那個人，就是對的人。而就在那一刻，我才恍然發現，原來那個人，一直都是你。同時，我也想起年少時曾向上帝獻上的一個禱告——渴望能遇見一位真正愛我的人。而如今回首，我才意識到，原來你就是上帝對我當時禱告的回應。</p>
                        <p>今天，在上帝與眾人的見證下，我願向你立下這份永恆的盟約，而這份盟約建立在耶穌基督那永不動搖的磐石之上。</p>
                        <p>無論未來的日子是高山還是低谷，我承諾一生以基督的愛來愛你、尊重你、陪伴你、聆聽你、支持你，並細心守護你。從今以後，我承諾用我的一生來成就你的生命，與你攜手建立我們的家。我承諾與你執子之手，與你一同創造更多屬於我們的幸福回憶，直至生命的最後一刻。同時，我承諾讓基督成為我們愛情與婚姻的主，邁向未來的每一步，完成上帝在我們生命中的共同夢想與使命，並一同見證基督那永不止息的愛。</p>
                        <p>我祈求上帝保守我們的婚姻、讓我們的愛經得起一切考驗，讓所有的風浪都使我們更加緊密，使我們在基督的愛中始終堅定、永不動搖。</p>
                        <p>老公，我愛你，無論是過去，現在、還是未來，直到我們回到天家的那一天！</p>

                        <h2>Hanson's Vow</h2>
                        <p>My dear Jeremiah,</p>
                        <p>Starting today, I will begin calling you "husband" instead of "dear." I wonder if you'll get used to it?</p>
                        <p>Perhaps I never told you, but I've always yearned for marriage since I was young. So today, standing here with you, my most beloved, experiencing this joyful moment together, feels like a "dream come true" to me. For this, I am truly grateful.</p>
                        <p>I want to thank you for all the love, encouragement, and patience you've given me over these years. I know I have many flaws, but you've always been patient with me, showering me with love, and giving me constant encouragement and confidence. Thank you for making me feel so cherished.</p>
                        <p>I also want to thank God for bringing you into my life. Fifteen years ago, when I first met you, I already knew you were the one I wanted to protect and care for. Even today, I still feel the same way. I'm grateful that my entire youth has been spent with you by my side, loving me. We've been through so much together and grown together. Thank you for supporting me with your abundant love, making me believe that no matter what the future holds, I won't be afraid because we'll face it together with courage and determination.</p>
                        <p>Of course, our relationship isn't just a journey between the two of us. God has been walking with us, witnessing our love and being our steadfast foundation.</p>
                        <p>Today, in the presence of God and our loved ones, I make this eternal covenant with you, built upon the unshakable foundation of Jesus Christ.</p>
                        <p>In the days to come, whether in joy or sorrow, I will stand by your side, loving you, respecting you, supporting you, and caring for you. I'll laugh with you in happy times and be your support in difficult moments. From today onwards, I'm not just your partner, I'm your family. I'll hold your hand and walk with you through every step of life. I'm willing to spend my entire life building our happy future together.</p>
                        <p>My husband, I love you, from the past, through the present, and into the future, until the day we return to our heavenly home.</p>

                        <p>從今天開始，我要開口從叫你「Dear」到叫你「老公」了，不知道你會不會習慣？</p>
                        <p>或許我不曾告訴你，其實我從小就非常嚮往婚姻。所以今天，能夠和我最愛的你站在這裡，共同經歷這個幸福的時刻，對我來說就像是"夢想成真"一樣。因此我真的非常感恩。</p>
                        <p>我要謝謝你，這些年來對我滿滿的愛、鼓勵和包容。我知道我有很多的缺點，但是你都依然一直的包容著我、寵愛著我，也給我很多鼓勵和信心，謝謝你，常常讓我活在這個幸福當中。</p>
                        <p>同時我也要感謝上帝把你放進了我的生命裡。15年前，當我第一次見到你時，我就已經知道你是那個我要一直守護、照顧的那個人。直到今天我還是這麼想的。我很感恩我的整個青春都有你陪伴著我、愛著我。這些年我們一起經歷了好多事情，也一起成長。謝謝你，一直以滿滿的愛支持我，讓我相信，無論未來是怎麼樣，我都不害怕，因為我們都會一起堅定、勇敢的走下去。當然，我們的關係不只是我們兩個人的旅程，而是有上帝一直在我們的關係中與我們同行，成為我們愛的見證和堅固的依靠。</p>
                        <p>今天，我在上帝與眾人的見證下，我願向你立下這份永恆的盟約，而這份盟約建立在耶穌基督那永不動搖的磐石之上。</p>
                        <p>未來的每一天，無論是快樂還是難過，我都會陪在你身邊，愛你、尊重你、支持你，還有照顧你。我會在快樂的時候跟你一起笑，在低谷的時候當你的依靠、陪伴著你。從今天開始，我不只是你的伴侶，我也是你的家人，我會牽著你的手，陪你走過生命的每一步。我願意用我的這一生，與你一起共築我們的幸福未來。</p>
                        <p>老公，我愛你，無論是過去、現在、還是未來，一直到我們回到天家的那一天。</p>
